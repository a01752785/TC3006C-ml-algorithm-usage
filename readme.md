# Usage of a Machine Learning Framework

This repository demonstrates the usage of the [DecisionTreeRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from the scikit-learn ML library. 

We are using the Boston Housing Dataset, which involves a regression problem. This dataset is no longer available given to ethical issues, but is well documented, for example, [here](https://rpubs.com/abbhinavsri30/BostonHousing).

We test the model using three different metrics: the Mean Squared Error, the Mean Absolute Error, and the Coefficient of Determination (R2), obtained from the validation set and the testing set.

## Running the binary

In order to execute the analysis, it is needed the installation of the libraries that the code uses.

Execute the following commands:

```
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install matplotlib
```

Then, execute the files for each dataset with the following command:

```
python decision_tree_regression.py
```
